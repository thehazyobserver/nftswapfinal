# MEME RUNNER Image Instructions

This file needs to be replaced with your actual yacht image.

Steps:
1. Find your MEME RUNNER yacht image file
2. Rename it to: meme-runner.png
3. Copy it to this exact location: 
   /frontend/public/images/collections/meme-runner.png

The image should be:
- PNG format preferred
- Square aspect ratio works best (e.g., 400x400px)
- Not too large (under 500KB recommended)

Once you replace this file with the actual image, the swap pool 
0x4C6D6010b75f5Da44598B74111fAEa9713dDd6da will show the yacht image.
